        <h4>Packets</h4>
        <hr>
        <h6>Definition:</h6>
        <p>How is the data transmitted through internet?. The data is not transmitted to the client or user directly from server over dedicated line. To send data it does not need to follow a fixed path. Information in internet is send in Packets. Packets are small, divided parts of data which are send from source to destination. Packets can vary depending upon size of data, they can take same or different path to reach the destination after reaching the destination the packets are reassembled into data. The path depends on traffic congestion or path conditions it may have to take different paths. The first image is what is there in packets.</p>
        <h6>Example:</h6>
        <p> Suppose you want to send an image to your friend then the image is divided in small packets as huge is of huge size. When you convert image into bits(0's and 1's) it can be form of millions and billions.This bits are stored in packets. Each packet consists of source and destination address. After reaching destination they reassemble into image again.  </p>
        <h6>Uses:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Help transmit bits in form of packets through network.</li>
          <li>Less loss of data.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Routing</h4>
        <hr>
        <h6>Definition:</h6>
        <p>Routing is a networking device used to select paths for packets between computer networks. Routing uses IP protocol to figure out all the paths that are possible to reach destination. Router is the device used for routing it stores paths in routing table. Routers job it to find the best and fastest possible path for the received IP packet. As IP packet consists of destination address the router checks in routing table if there are any paths.If there are any the router forwards the packets.</p>
        <h6>Example:</h6>
        <p>Suppose there are two computers A and B, A wants to send data to B and there two paths 1 and 2( this two paths divide after A is connected to a router).
        1. Path 1 has 5 routers and traffic congestion.
        2. Path 2 has 2 routers and no traffic congestion.
        So, router which is connected to A will select path 2 as it has less routers and no traffic.
        </p>
        <h6>Uses:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Selects path for the IP packets.</li>
          <li>Helps in faster transmission of data.</li>
